    /**
     * Import a new bank connection

All bank accounts will be downloaded and imported with their current balances, transactions and supported two-step-procedures (note that the amount of available transactions may vary between banks, e.g. some banks deliver all transactions from the past year, others only deliver the transactions from the past three months). The balance and transactions download process runs asynchronously, so this service may return before all balances and transactions have been imported. Also, all downloaded transactions will be categorized by a separate background process that runs asynchronously too. To check the status of the balance and transactions download process as well as the background categorization process, see the status flags that are returned by the GET /bankConnections/<id> service.<br/><br/>You can also import a \"demo connection\" which contains a single bank account with some pre-defined transactions. To import the demo connection, you need to pass the identifier of the \"finAPI Test Bank\". In case of demo connection import, any other fields besides the bank identifier can remain unset. The bankingUserId, bankingCustomerId, bankingPin, and storeSecrets fields will be stored if you pass them, however they will not be regarded when updating the demo connection (in other words: It doesn't matter what credentials you choose for the demo connection). Note however that if you want to import the demo connection multiple times for the same user, you must use a different bankingUserId and/or bankingCustomerId for each of the imports. Also note that the skipPositionsDownload flag is ignored for the demo bank connection, i.e. when importing the demo bank connection, you will always get the transactions for its account. You can enable multi-step authentication for the demo bank connection by setting the bank connection name to \"MSA\".<br/><br/>The XS2A interface could also be used to initiate a demo connection import.<br/>The finAPI demo XS2A allows you to download a test account by using the 'import' or 'connectInterface' services - in general, this XS2A demo account is the FINTS_SERVER demo account, as it has the same account number and origin of balances and transactions.<br/>Keep in mind, that calling an XS2A demo connection import will result as a newly created bank connection, when the 'connectInterface' service attaches the XS2A demo account to an existing demo connection.<br/>Passing the login credentials is not obligated only for redirect banks, however the demo bank works without any given set of credentials for the XS2A interface. The old API credentials fields (bankingUserId, bankingCustomerId, bankingPin) are DEPRECATED and temporarily mapped on the new credentials data structure, allowing you to use them within the XS2A import. This is not recommended, as those fields are going to be removed at some point later.<br/>If you are looking to test the XS2A SCA (Strong Customer Authentication, or MSA (Multi-Step Authentication) in the finAPI context), you need to pass the bank connection name as \"MSA\" to trigger the SCA flow or as 'DECOUPLED-AUTH' to simulate decoupled authentication. To get better understanding about the Multi-Step Authentication, please refer to the 'Error Messages' section of the swagger documentation.<br/><br/><b>For a more in-depth understanding of the import process, please also read this article on our Dev Portal: <a href='https://finapi.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000296607-Import-Update-of-Bank-Connections-Accounts' target='_blank'>Import & Update of Bank Connections / Accounts</a></b><br/><br/>NOTE: Depending on your license, this service may respond with HTTP code 451, containing an error message with a identifier of web form in it.

     * Update a bank connection
     * Update an existing bank connection of the user that is authorized by the access_token. Downloads and imports the current account balances and new transactions. Note that if the bank connection has several interfaces and some of its accounts was previously imported or updated via an interface which have higher priority than the interface used in the current update, then balances and transactions will not be downloaded for such accounts (The XS2A interface has the highest priority, followed by FINTS_SERVER and finally WEB_SCRAPER). Must pass the connection's identifier and the user's access_token. For more information about the processes of authentication, data download and transactions categorization, see POST /bankConnections/import. Note that supported two-step-procedures are updated as well. It may unset the current default two-step-procedure of the given bank connection (but only if this procedure is not supported anymore by the bank). You can also update the \"demo connection\" (in this case, the fields 'bankingPin', 'importNewAccounts', and 'skipPositionsDownload' will be ignored).<br/><br/>Note that you cannot trigger an update of a bank connection as long as there is still a previously triggered update running.<br/><br/><b>For a more in-depth understanding of the update process, please also read this article on our Dev Portal: <a href='https://finapi.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000296607-Import-Update-of-Bank-Connections-Accounts' target='_blank'>Import & Update of Bank Connections / Accounts</a></b><br/><br/>NOTE: Depending on your license, this service may respond with HTTP code 451, containing an error message with a identifier of web form in it. In addition to that the response will also have included a 'Location' header, which contains the URL to the web form. In this case, you must forward your user to finAPI's web form. For a detailed explanation of the Web Form Flow, please refer to this article: <a href='https://finapi.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360002596391' target='_blank'>finAPI's Web Form Flow</a><br/><br/><b>Attention:</b> Due to changes on the bank's side we have been forced to limit the transaction download time frame to 89 days. Now any update of a bank connection will fetch the last three months of transactions per account. If the last successful update was more than 3 months ago, an adjusting entry ('Zwischensaldo' transaction) will be created.
