   * @param id {Number} Bank connection identifier
   * @param bankId {Number} Identifier of the bank that this connection belongs to. NOTE: This field is DEPRECATED and will get removed at some point. Please refer to the 'bank' field instead.
   * @param type {module:model/BankConnection.TypeEnum} Bank connection type
   * @param updateStatus {module:model/BankConnection.UpdateStatusEnum} Current status of data download (account balances and transactions/securities). The POST /bankConnections/import and POST /bankConnections/<id>/update services will set this flag to IN_PROGRESS before they return. Once the import or update has finished, the status will be changed to READY.
   * @param categorizationStatus {module:model/BankConnection.CategorizationStatusEnum} Current status of transactions categorization. The asynchronous download process that is triggered by a call of the POST /bankConnections/import and POST /bankConnections/<id>/update services (and also by finAPI's auto update, if enabled) will set this flag to PENDING once the download has finished and a categorization is scheduled for the imported transactions. A separate categorization thread will then start to categorize the transactions (during this process, the status is IN_PROGRESS). When categorization has finished, the status will be (re-)set to READY. Note that the current categorization status should only be queried after the download has finished, i.e. once the download status has switched from IN_PROGRESS to READY.
   * @param ibanOnlyMoneyTransferSupported {Boolean} NOTE: This field is deprecated and will be removed at some point. Please refer to the account capabilities instead.<br><br>Whether this bank connection accepts money transfer requests where the recipient's account is defined just by the IBAN (without an additional BIC). This field is re-evaluated each time this bank connection is updated. <br/>See also: /accounts/requestSepaMoneyTransfer
   * @param ibanOnlyDirectDebitSupported {Boolean} NOTE: This field is deprecated and will be removed at some point. Please refer to the account capabilities instead.<br><br>Whether this bank connection accepts direct debit requests where the debitor's account is defined just by the IBAN (without an additional BIC). This field is re-evaluated each time this bank connection is updated. <br/>See also: /accounts/requestSepaDirectDebit
   * @param collectiveMoneyTransferSupported {Boolean} NOTE: This field is deprecated and will be removed at some point. Please refer to the account capabilities instead.<br><br>Whether this bank connection supports submitting collective money transfers. This field is re-evaluated each time this bank connection is updated. <br/>See also: /accounts/requestSepaMoneyTransfer
   * @param accountIds {Array.<Number>} Identifiers of the accounts that belong to this bank connection
   * @param bank {module:model/Bank} Bank that this connection belongs to
   * @param furtherLoginNotRecommended {Boolean} This field indicates whether the last communication with the bank failed with an error that requires the user's attention or multi-step authentication error. If 'furtherLoginNotRecommended' is true, finAPI will stop auto updates of this bank connection to mitigate the risk of the user's bank account getting locked by the bank. Every communication with the bank (via updates, money_transfers, direct debits. etc.) can change the value of this flag. If this field is true, we recommend the user to check his credentials and try a manual update of the bank connection. If the update is successful without any multi-step authentication error, the 'furtherLoginNotRecommended' field will be set to false and the bank connection will be reincluded in the next batch update process. A manual update of the bank connection with incorrect credentials or if multi-step authentication error happens will set this field to true and lead to the exclusion of the bank connection from the following batch updates.
