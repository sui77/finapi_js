   * @class
   * @param id {Number} Bank identifier.<br/><br/>NOTE: Do NOT assume that the identifiers of banks are the same across different finAPI environments. In fact, the identifiers may change whenever a new finAPI version is released, even within the same environment. The identifiers are meant to be used for references within the finAPI services only, but not for hard-coding them in your application. If you need to hard-code the usage of a certain bank within your application, please instead refer to the BLZ.
   * @param name {String} Name of bank
   * @param blzs {Array.<String>} THIS FIELD IS DEPRECATED AND WILL BE REMOVED. Refer to the 'blz' field instead.
   * @param blz {String} BLZ of bank
   * @param isSupported {Boolean} THIS FIELD IS DEPRECATED AND WILL BE REMOVED. Please refer to field 'interfaces' instead.<br/><br/>Whether this bank is supported by finAPI, i.e. whether you can import/update a bank connection of this bank.
   * @param isTestBank {Boolean} If true, then this bank does not depict a real bank, but rather a testing endpoint provided by a bank or by finAPI. You probably want to regard these banks only during the development of your application, but not in production. You can filter out these banks in production by making sure that the 'isTestBank' parameter is always set to 'false' whenever your application is calling the 'Get and search all banks' service.
   * @param popularity {Number} Popularity of this bank with your users (mandator-wide, i.e. across all of your clients). The value equals the number of bank connections that are currently imported for this bank across all of your users (which means it is a constantly adjusting value). You can use this field for statistical evaluation, and also for ordering bank search results (see service 'Get and search all banks').
   * @param health {Number} THIS FIELD IS DEPRECATED AND WILL BE REMOVED. Refer to the 'health' in the 'interfaces' instead. <br/><br/>The health status of this bank. This is a value between 0 and 100, depicting the percentage of successful communication attempts with this bank during the latest couple of bank connection imports or updates (across the entire finAPI system). Note that 'successful' means that there was no technical error trying to establish a communication with the bank. Non-technical errors (like incorrect credentials) are regarded successful communication attempts.
   * @param pinsAreVolatile {Boolean} THIS FIELD IS DEPRECATED AND WILL BE REMOVED. Refer to the 'isVolatile' field of the 'loginCredentials' in 'interfaces' instead.<br/><br/>Whether the PINs that are used for authentication with the bank are volatile. If the PINs are volatile, it means that a PIN is usually valid only for a single authentication, and is then invalidated. If a bank uses volatile PINs, it is strongly inadvisable to store PINs in finAPI, as a stored PIN will not work for future authentications.<br><br>NOTE: This field is deprecated and will be removed at some point.
   * @param isCustomerIdPassword {Boolean} THIS FIELD IS DEPRECATED AND WILL BE REMOVED. Refer to the 'isSecret' field of the 'loginCredentials' in 'interfaces' instead.<br/><br/>Whether the banking customer ID has to be treated like a password. Certain banks require a second password (besides the PIN) for the user to login. In this case your application should use a password input field when prompting users for their credentials.<br><br>NOTE: This field is deprecated and will be removed at some point. 
   * @param supportedDataSources {Array.<module:model/Bank.SupportedDataSourcesEnum>} THIS FIELD IS DEPRECATED AND WILL BE REMOVED. Refer to the 'interfaces' instead.<br/><br/>List of the data sources that finAPI will use for data download for this bank. Possible values:<br><br>&bull; <code>FINTS_SERVER</code> - means that finAPI will download data via the bank's FinTS interface.<br>&bull; <code>WEB_SCRAPER</code> - means that finAPI will parse data from the bank's online banking website.<br><br>Note that this list will be empty for non-supported banks. Note also that web scraping might be disabled for your client (see GET /clientConfiguration). When this is the case, then finAPI will not use the web scraper for data download, and if the web scraper is the only supported data source of this bank, then finAPI will not allow to download any data for this bank at all (for details, see POST /bankConnections/import and POST /bankConnections/update).
